# ColourFlow

ColourFlow creates images of random colour gradients. The first pixel in the middle of the canvas is filled randomly with a colour. Afterwards the colour "flows" in all directions until the whole canvas is filled. Screenshots, explanation of further functionalities and information about local properties can be found below.
