# ColourFlow

ColourFlow creates images of random colour gradients. The first pixel in the middle of the canvas is filled randomly with a colour. Afterwards the colour "flows" in all directions until the whole canvas is filled. Screenshots and the explanation of further functionalities can be found below.
